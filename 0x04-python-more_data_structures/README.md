    . What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
    . When to use sets versus lists
    . How to iterate into a set
    . What are dictionaries and how to use them
    . When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
    . What is a key in a dictionary
    . How to iterate over a dictionary
    . What is a lambda function
    . What are the map, reduce and filter functions
    . What are lists and how to use them

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

    . All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	. All files should end with a new line
	. The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
	. A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
    . Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	. All files must be executable
	. The length of files will be tested using wc

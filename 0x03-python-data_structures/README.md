## Requirements

### Python Scripts

	. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
. All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
	. All files should end with a new line
	. The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
	. A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
. Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
	. All files must be executable
	. The length of files will be tested using wc

### C

## Description of files in the repository

	. 0-print_list_integer.py - a function that prints all integers of a list
	. 1-element_at.py - a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
	. 2-replace_in_list.py - a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
	. 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py - a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
	. 4-new_in_list.py - a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
